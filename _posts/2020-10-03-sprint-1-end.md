Greetings!

Sprint 1 has now ended, the sprint went very well. Both the internal teams achieved the goals of the sprint.

The goal for the automation team was to make a simple demo that sends a email, this entails the task of creating a simple CLI, defining a API and implementing a automation module for sending emails. The API is used to make it easier to add new automation models like booking a meeting for example. It is used by the NLP module for finding the right automation model to call.

The goal for the NLP team was to come up with a solution for the NLP part of the project. This was very hard to do, thus we decided to implement a simple solution using SpaCy and there pre made models. The solution uses SpaCy to categories words and then we check if any of the verbs are similar to the automation modules predefined verbs. That turn out to work pretty well and got implemented in the sprint.

For the next sprint, sprint 2, the goal for the automation team is to implement a module for setting a alarm/notification and a module for booking a meeting. The goal for the NLP team is to make a NLP model that can understand the intent of a sentence.
